WattVision: Advanced Power Consumption Analysis and Prediction Platform

Objective
The objective of this project was to design and implement a database system capable of analyzing power consumption across different zones within a city, considering various environmental factors. This report outlines the systematic approach taken from conceptualization to the final implementation of the database, focusing on a relational model for structured data storage and a NoSQL model for flexible, schema-less data storage.
Background
The project is based on an investigation into power usage patterns in Tetouan, a city in Morocco, which has been demarcated into three distinct areas: Bousafu, Smir, and Quads. This division seems to be part of a focused study on energy consumption. However, there is a significant obstacle: the lack of readily available online information about these zones, which hampers the ability to ascertain the nature of each area, such as whether they are residential neighborhoods, industrial districts, or commercial hubs.
In response to this informational void, an empirical approach is taken by calculating the average electricity usage for each zone. 
The consumption figures are as follows:
Zone 1 (Bousafu): The data reveals a substantial average electricity usage of approximately 32,300.70 kWh.
Zone 2 (Smir): A moderately lower consumption level, with an average of about 21,016.21 kWh.
Zone 3 (Quads): The smallest average usage of roughly 17,821.68 kWh.
The high energy demand in Zone 1 suggests that it might be an area of heavy industry or possess a dense concentration of large businesses that typically consume more power. Conversely, Zones 2 and 3 exhibit lower energy usage, which could imply a predominance of residential areas or the presence of smaller businesses and fewer energy-intensive facilities. These statistics are leveraged to hypothesize about the character and possible utility of each zone.This analytical approach highlights a data-driven methodology to inform about the potential infrastructure and societal layout of the city's divisions in the absence of direct information. Without concrete data, such inferences are tentative and invite further research to validate or refine the understanding of Tetouan's power consumption landscape.
